# Tipps

## chapters
All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

## A section

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.


## cross-referenc: Chapters and sub-chapters

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>


## Equations

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation} 

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).


## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {.theorem #tri}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
